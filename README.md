This program was made for the SDLC Part 2 assignment in CEN 3024C.
Itâ€™s a simple library management system that lets you manage a list of patrons using a text-based menu.

You can add, remove, search, and import patrons from a file.
Everything updates right away, and the menu keeps running until you choose to exit.

The program can be run in IntelliJ IDEA or as a standalone JAR file.
It was built to practice the Software Development Life Cycle and version control with Git and GitHub.
