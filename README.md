This program was created for the SDLC Part 2 assignment in CEN 3024C. 
It is the library management system that allows users to manage a list of patrons through a text-based menu. 

The system supports adding, removing, and searching for patrons, as well as importing patron data from a text file. 
All changes are updated immediately, and the menu continues to run until the user chooses to exit. 
The program can be run directly in IntelliJ IDEA or as a standalone JAR file.

This project was developed as part of a course assignment to practice implementing the Software Development Life Cycle and version control using Git and GitHub.
